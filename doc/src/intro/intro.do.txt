===== Lectures and ComputerLab =====

!bblock
  * Lectures: time and place to be determined
  * Lab: time and place to be determined
  * Weekly reading assignments needed to solve projects.
  * First part of a lab session may be used to discuss technicalities and issues related to additional software
  * Detailed lecture notes, exercises, all programs presented, projects etc can be found at the homepage of the course.
  * Weekly plans and all other information are at the github address of the course.  Weekly emails about plans and progress will be sent to you all.
  * Final oral exam to be determined

===== Course Format =====

!bblock
  * Several computer exercises, 4 compulsory projects. Electronic reports only using "Git":"https://github.com/" for repository and all your material.
  * Evaluation and grading: Each project counts 20% of the final mark. The final oral exam counts 20%. A tentative feedback form on projects can be found at the github address of the "course":"https://github.com/CompPhysics/ComputationalPhysicsMSU/tree/master/doc/Admin"
  * The computer lab consists of 16 Linux PCs, but many prefer own laptops. C/C++ is the default programming language, but Fortran2008 and Python are also used. 
  * All source codes discussed during the lectures and for each chapter can be found at the "github address":"https://github.com/CompPhysics/ComputationalPhysicsMSU/tree/master/doc/Programs" of the course. We recommend either C/C++, Fortran2008 or Python as languages.
