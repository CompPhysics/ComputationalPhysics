===== Lectures and ComputerLab =====

!bblock
  * Lectures: Thursday (8.15am-10am) and Friday (8.15am-10am).
  * Weekly reading assignments needed to solve projects.
  * First hour of each lab session may be used to discuss technicalities, address questions etc linked with projects.
  * Detailed lecture notes, exercises, all programs presented, projects etc can be found at the homepage of the course.
  * Computerlab: Thursday (10am-6pm) and Friday (10am-6pm) room FV329.
  * Weekly plans and all other information are on the official webpage.
  * No final exam, the last three projects are graded.  In total five projects which all have to be approved.

===== Course Format =====

!bblock
  * Several computer exercises, 5 compulsory projects. Electronic reports only using "devilry":"https://devilry.ifi.uio.no/" to hand in projects and "Git":"https://github.com/" for repository and all your material.
  * Evaluation and grading: The last three projects are graded and each counts 1/3 of the final mark. No final written or oral exam.
  * The computer lab (room FV329)consists of 16 Linux PCs, but many prefer own laptops. C/C++ is the default programming language, but Fortran2008 and Python are also used. All source codes discussed during the lectures can be found at the webpage and "github address":"https://github.com/CompPhysics/ComputationalPhysics1/tree/master/doc/Programs" of the course. We recommend either C/C++, Fortran2008 or Python as languages.
