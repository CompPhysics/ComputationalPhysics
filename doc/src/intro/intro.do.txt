First time: Thursday and Friday this week, Presentation of hardware and software at room FV329 first hour of every labgroup and solution of first simple exercises. The first two weeks we focus on simple programming exercises and to set up github and QTcreator. This week we discuss how to set up git and obtain a github account and look at two simple programming exercises and for those interested start with project 1.

===== Course Format =====

!bblock
  * Five compulsory projects. Electronic reports only using "devilry":"https://devilry.ifi.uio.no/" to hand in projects and "Git":"https://github.com/" for repository and all your material.
  * Evaluation and grading: The last three projects are graded and each counts 1/3 of the final mark. No final written or oral exam.
  * The computer lab (room FV329)consists of 16 Linux PCs, but many prefer own laptops. C/C++ is the default programming language, but Fortran2008 and Python are also used. All source codes discussed during the lectures can be found at the webpage and "github address":"https://github.com/CompPhysics/ComputationalPhysics1/tree/master/doc/Programs" of the course. We recommend either C/C++, Fortran2008 or Python as languages.

  * This means to teach you structured scientific computing, learn to structure a project.
  * A critical understanding of central mathematical algorithms and methods from numerical analysis. In particular their limits and stability criteria.
  * Always try to find good checks of your codes (like solutions on closed form)
  * To enable you to develop a critical view on the mathematical model and the physics.
