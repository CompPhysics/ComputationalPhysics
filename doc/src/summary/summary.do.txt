===== Learning outcomes and overarching aims of this course =====

  * Develop a critical approach to all steps in a project, which methods are most relevant, which natural laws and physical processes are important. Sort out initial conditions and boundary conditions etc.
  * This means to teach you structured scientific computing, learn to structure a project.
  * A critical understanding of central mathematical algorithms and methods from numerical analysis. In particular their limits and stability criteria.
  * Always try to find good checks of your codes (like solutions on closed form)
  * To enable you to develop a critical view on the mathematical models and the specific scientific case under study.

===== "New Master of Science program at UiO in Computational Science from Fall 2018":"http://mhjensen.github.io/CPMLS/doc/pub/Masterprogram/html/Masterprogram.html"  =====
The program aims at offering thesis projects in a variety of fields. The scientists involved in this program can offer thesis
topics that cover several disciplines. The program has 60 study places and the study directions are

* Computational Science:  Applied Mathematics and Risk Analysis (14)
* Computational Science:  Astrophysics  (2)
* Computational Science:  Bioinformatics (5)
* Computational Science:  Bioscience   (4)
* Computational Science:  Chemistry (4)
* Computational Science:  Geoscience  (5)
* Computational Science:  Imaging and Biomedical computing (8)
* Computational Science:  Material Science (2)
* Computational Science:  Mechanics (8)
* Computational Science:  Physics  (8)
* Computational Science:  Economy and Finance (not clear yet)

The thesis projects will be tailored to the student's needs, wishes and scientific background. The projects can easily incorporate topics from more than one discipline.

===== The program opens up for flexible backgrounds  =====

While discipline-based master's programs tend to introduce very strict
requirements to courses, we believe in adapting a computational thesis
topic to the student's background, thereby opening up for
students with a wide range of bachelor's degrees.
A very heterogeneous student community is thought to be a strength and
unique feature of this program. Most study directions 
have a minimum course requirement of 120 ECTS (European Credit Transfer System) at the undergraduate level (bachelor degree or equivalent) in Astrophysics, bioscience, chemistry, computer science and informatics, geoscience, mathematics, materials science, mechanics and physics. Of these 120 ECTS, 40 ECTS have to include basic mathematics and programming courses, equivalent to the University of Oslo mathematics courses MAT1100, MAT1110, MAT1120 and at least one of the corresponding computing and programming courses INF1000/INF1110 or MAT-INF1100/MAT-INF1100L/BIOS1100/KJM-INF1xxx. 
    The remaining 80 ECTS have to be within at most two of the fields of astrophysics, bioscience, chemistry, computer science and informatics, geoscience, mathematics, materials science, mechanics and physics. 40 of these 80 ECTS have to be advanced undergraduate courses at the 2000 and 3000 level and a minimum of 20 ECTS must be at the 3000 level within physics/material science/mechanics/astrophysics/informatics/mathematics/bioscience/chemistry/geoscience.

=====  Best wishes to you all and thanks so much for your heroic efforts this semester =====
