=====     Optimization and profiling =====
!bblock


Till now we have not paid much attention to speed and possible optimization possibilities
inherent in the various compilers. We have compiled and linked as
!bc cppcod
c++  -c  mycode.cpp
c++  -o  mycode.exe  mycode.o
!ec
For Fortran replace with for example _gfortran_ or _ifort_.
This is what we call a flat compiler option and should be used when we develop the code.
It produces normally a very large and slow code when translated to machine instructions.
We use this option for debugging and for establishing the correct program output because
every operation is done precisely as the user specified it.

It is instructive to look up the compiler manual for further instructions by writing
!bc cppcod
man c++
!ec

!eblock
!split
===== More on optimization =====
!bblock
We have additional compiler options for optimization. These may include procedure inlining where 
performance may be improved, moving constants inside loops outside the loop, 
identify potential parallelism, include automatic vectorization or replace a division with a reciprocal
and a multiplication if this speeds up the code.
!bc cppcod
c++  -O3 -c  mycode.cpp
c++  -O3 -o  mycode.exe  mycode.o
!ec
This (other options are -O2 or -Ofast) is the recommended option. 


!eblock
!split
=====    Optimization and profiling  =====
!bblock
It is also useful to profile your program under the development stage.
You would then compile with 
!bc cppcod
c++  -pg -O3 -c  mycode.cpp
c++  -pg -O3 -o  mycode.exe  mycode.o
!ec
After you have run the code you can obtain the profiling information via
!bc cppcod
gprof mycode.exe >  ProfileOutput
!ec
When you have profiled properly your code, you must take out this option as it 
slows down performance.
For memory tests use "valgrind":"http://www.valgrind.org". An excellent environment for all these aspects, and much  more, is  Qt creator.

!eblock

!split
=====    Optimization and debugging  =====
!bblock
Adding debugging options is a very useful alternative under the development stage of a program.
You would then compile with 
!bc cppcod
c++  -g -O0 -c  mycode.cpp
c++  -g -O0 -o  mycode.exe  mycode.o
!ec
This option generates debugging information allowing you to trace for example if an array is properly allocated. Some compilers work best with the no optimization option _-O0_. 
!eblock
!bblock Other optimization flags 
Depending on the compiler, one can add flags which generate code that catches integer overflow errors. 
The flag _-ftrapv_ does this for the CLANG compiler on OS X operating systems.   
!eblock



!split
=====    Other hints  =====
!bblock
In general, irrespective of compiler options, it is useful to
* avoid if tests or call to functions inside loops, if possible. 
* avoid multiplication with constants inside loops if possible
Here is an example of a part of a program where specific operations lead to a slower code
!bc cppcod
k = n-1;
for (i = 0; i < n; i++){
    a[i] = b[i] +c*d;
    e = g[k];
}
!ec
A better code is
!bc cppcod
temp = c*d;
for (i = 0; i < n; i++){
    a[i] = b[i] + temp;
}
e = g[n-1];
!ec
Here we avoid a repeated multiplication inside a loop. 
Most compilers, depending on compiler flags, identify and optimize such bottlenecks on their own, without requiring any particular action by the programmer. However, it is always useful to single out and avoid code examples like the first one discussed here.

===== Vectorization and the basic idea behind parallel computing =====
!bblock
Present CPUs are highly parallel processors with varying levels of parallelism. The typical situation can be described via the following three statements.
* Pursuit of shorter computation time and larger simulation size gives rise to parallel computing.
* Multiple processors are involved to solve a global problem.
* The essence is to divide the entire computation evenly among collaborative processors.  Divide and conquer.

Before we proceed with a more detailed discussion of topics like vectorization and parallelization, we need to remind ourselves about some basic features of different hardware models. 

!eblock

!split
===== A rough classification of hardware models  =====
!bblock

* Conventional single-processor computers are named SISD (single-instruction-single-data) machines.
* SIMD (single-instruction-multiple-data) machines incorporate the idea of parallel processing, using a large number of processing units to execute the same instruction on different data.
* Modern parallel computers are so-called MIMD (multiple-instruction-multiple-data) machines and can execute different instruction streams in parallel on different data.


!eblock
!split
=====  Shared memory and distributed memory =====
!bblock
One way of categorizing modern parallel computers is to look at the memory configuration.
* In shared memory systems the CPUs share the same address space. Any CPU can access any data in the global memory.
* In distributed memory systems each CPU has its own memory.

The CPUs are connected by some network and may exchange messages.

!eblock

!split
=====    Different parallel programming paradigms  =====
!bblock

* _Task parallelism_:  the work of a global problem can be divided into a number of independent tasks, which rarely need to synchronize.  Monte Carlo simulations represent a typical situation. Integration is another. However this paradigm is of limited use.
* _Data parallelism_:  use of multiple threads (e.g. one or more threads per processor) to dissect loops over arrays etc.  Communication and synchronization between processors are often hidden, thus easy to program. However, the user surrenders much control to a specialized compiler. Examples of data parallelism are compiler-based parallelization and OpenMP directives. 

!eblock
!split
=====    Different parallel programming paradigms =====
!bblock

* _Message passing_:  all involved processors have an independent memory address space. The user is responsible for  partitioning the data/work of a global problem and distributing the  subproblems to the processors. Collaboration between processors is achieved by explicit message passing, which is used for data transfer plus synchronization.

* This paradigm is the most general one where the user has full control. Better parallel efficiency is usually achieved by explicit message passing. However, message-passing programming is more difficult.

===== What is vectorization? ===== 
Vectorization is a special
case of _Single Instructions Multiple Data_ (SIMD) to denote a single
instruction stream capable of operating on multiple data elements in
parallel. 
We can think of vectorization as the unrolling of loops accompanied with SIMD instructions.

Vectorization is the process of converting an algorithm that performs scalar operations
(typically one operation at the time) to vector operations where a single operation can refer to many simultaneous operations.
Consider the following example
!bc cppcod
for (i = 0; i < n; i++){
    a[i] = b[i] + c[i];
}
!ec
If the code is not vectorized, the compiler will simply start with the first element and 
then perform subsequent additions operating on one address in memory at the time. 

!split 
===== Number of elements that can acted upon =====
A SIMD instruction can operate  on multiple data elements in one single instruction.
It uses the so-called 128-bit SIMD floating-point register. 
In this sense,vectorization adds some form of parallelism since one instruction is applied  
to many parts of say a vector.

The number of elements which can be operated on in parallel
range from four single-precision floating point data elements in so-called 
Streaming SIMD Extensions and two double-precision floating-point data
elements in Streaming SIMD Extensions 2 to sixteen byte operations in
a 128-bit register in Streaming SIMD Extensions 2. Thus, vector-length
ranges from 2 to 16, depending on the instruction extensions used and
on the data type. 

!split 
===== Number of elements that can acted upon, examples =====
We start with the simple scalar operations given by
!bc cppcod
for (i = 0; i < n; i++){
    a[i] = b[i] + c[i];
}
!ec
If the code is not vectorized  and we have a 128-bit register to store a 32 bits floating point number,
it means that we have $3\times 32$ bits that are not used. For the first element we have


|-------------------------------|
| 0 | 1 | 2 | 3                 | 
|-------------------------------|
| a[0]= | not used | not used| not used|
|-------------------------------|
| b[0]+ | not used | not used| not used|
|-------------------------------|
| c[0] | not used | not used| not used|
|-------------------------------|

We have thus unused space in our SIMD registers. These registers could hold three additional integers.



!split 
===== Number of elements that can acted upon, examples =====
If we vectorize the code, we can perform, with a 128-bit register four simultaneous operations, that is
we have
!bc cppcod
for (i = 0; i < n; i+=4){
    a[i] = b[i] + c[i];
    a[i+1] = b[i+1] + c[i+1];
    a[i+2] = b[i+2] + c[i+2];
    a[i+3] = b[i+3] + c[i+3];
}
!ec
displayed here as

|-------------------------------|
| 0 | 1 | 2 | 3                 | 
|-------------------------------|
|  a[0]= | a[1]= | a[2]=| a[3]= |
|-------------------------------|
|  b[0]+ | b[1]+ | b[2]+| b[3]+ |
|-------------------------------|
| c[0]| c[1] | c[2] | c[3]      | 
|-------------------------------|
Four additions are now done in a single step.

===== "A simple test case with and without vectorization":"https://github.com/CompPhysics/ComputationalPhysicsMSU/blob/master/doc/Programs/LecturePrograms/programs/Classes/cpp/program7.cpp" =====
We implement these operations in a simple c++ program as 

!bc cppcode
#include <cstdlib>
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
#include <iomanip>
#include "time.h" 

using namespace std; // note use of namespace                                       
int main (int argc, char* argv[])
{
  int i = atoi(argv[1]); 
  double *a, *b, *c;
  a = new double[i]; 
  b = new double[i]; 
  c = new double[i]; 
  for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
    a[j] = 0.0;
    b[j] = cos(j*1.0);
    c[j] = sin(j*3.0);
  }
  clock_t start, finish;
  start = clock();
  for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
    a[j] = b[j]+b[j]*c[j];
  }
  finish = clock();
  double timeused = (double) (finish - start)/(CLOCKS_PER_SEC );
  cout << setiosflags(ios::showpoint | ios::uppercase);
  cout << setprecision(10) << setw(20) << "Time used  for vector addition and multiplication=" << timeused  << endl;
  delete [] a;
  delete [] b;
  delete [] c;
  return 0;     
}
!ec


!split 
===== Compiling with and without vectorization =====
We can compile and link without vectorization
!bc cppcod
c++ -o novec.x vecexample.cpp
!ec
and with vectorization (and additional optimizations)
!bc cppcod
c++ -O3 -o  vec.x vecexample.cpp 
!ec
The speedup depends on the size of the vectors. In the example here we have run with $10^7$ elements.
The example here was run on a PC with ubuntu 14.04 as operating system and an Intel i7-4790 CPU running at 3.60 GHz. 
!bc cppcod 
Compphys:~ hjensen$ ./vec.x 10000000
Time used  for vector addition = 0.0100000
Compphys:~ hjensen$ ./novec.x 10000000
Time used  for vector addition = 0.03000000000
!ec
This particular C++ compiler speeds up the above loop operations with a factor of 3. 
Performing the same operations for $10^8$ elements results only in a factor $1.4$.
The result will however vary from compiler to compiler. In general however, with optimization flags like $-O3$ or $-Ofast$, we gain a considerable speedup if our code can be vectorized. Many of these operations can be done automatically by your compiler. These automatic or near automatic compiler techniques improve performance considerably. 

!split
=====  Automatic vectorization and vectorization inhibitors, criteria =====

Not all loops can be vectorized, as discussed in "Intel's guide to vectorization":"https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/a-guide-to-auto-vectorization-with-intel-c-compilers"

An important criteria is that the loop counter $n$ is known at the entry of the loop.
!bc cppcod
  for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    a[j] = cos(j*1.0);
  }
!ec
The variable $n$ does need to be known at compile time. However, this variable must stay the same for the entire duration of the loop. It implies that an exit statement inside the loop cannot be data dependent.

!split
=====  Automatic vectorization and vectorization inhibitors, exit criteria =====

An exit statement should in general be avoided. 
If the exit statement contains data-dependent conditions, the loop cannot be vectorized. 
The following is an example of a non-vectorizable loop
!bc cppcod
  for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    a[j] = cos(j*1.0);
    if (a[j] < 0 ) break;
  }
!ec
Avoid loop termination conditions and opt for a single entry loop variable $n$. The lower and upper bounds have to be kept fixed within the loop. 
!split
=====  Automatic vectorization and vectorization inhibitors, straight-line code =====
SIMD instructions perform the same type of operations multiple times. 
A _switch_ statement leads thus to a non-vectorizable loop since different statemens cannot branch.
The following code can however be vectorized since the _if_ statement is implemented as a masked assignment.
!bc cppcod
  for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    double x  = cos(j*1.0);
    if (x > 0 ) {
       a[j] =  x*sin(j*2.0); 
    }
    else {
       a[j] = 0.0;
    }
  }
!ec
These operations can be performed for all data elements but only those elements which the mask evaluates as true are stored. In general, one should avoid branches such as _switch_, _go to_, or _return_ statements or _if_ constructs that cannot be treated as masked assignments. 


!split
=====  Automatic vectorization and vectorization inhibitors, nested loops =====

Only the innermost loop of the following example is vectorized
!bc cppcod
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
           a[i][j] += b[i][j];
      }  
  }
!ec
The exception is if an original outer loop is transformed into an inner loop as the result of compiler optimizations.


!split
=====  Automatic vectorization and vectorization inhibitors, function calls =====

Calls to programmer defined functions ruin vectorization. However, calls to intrinsic functions like
$\sin{x}$, $\cos{x}$, $\exp{x}$ etc are allowed since they are normally efficiently vectorized. 
The following example is fully vectorizable
!bc cppcod
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      a[i] = log10(i)*cos(i);
  }
!ec
Similarly, _inline_ functions defined by the programmer, allow for vectorization since the function statements are glued into the actual place where the function is called. 


!split
=====  Automatic vectorization and vectorization inhibitors, data dependencies =====

One has to keep in mind that vectorization changes the order of operations inside a loop. A so-called
read-after-write statement with an explicit flow dependency cannot be vectorized. The following code
!bc cppcod
  double b = 15.;
  for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
      a[i] = a[i-1] + b;
  }
!ec
is an example of flow dependency and results in wrong numerical results if vectorized. For a scalar operation, the value $a[i-1]$ computed during the iteration is loaded into the right-hand side and the results are fine. In vector mode however, with a vector length of four, the values $a[0]$, $a[1]$, $a[2]$ and $a[3]$ from the previous loop will be loaded into the right-hand side and produce wrong results. That is, we have
!bc cppcod
   a[1] = a[0] + b;
   a[2] = a[1] + b;
   a[3] = a[2] + b;
   a[4] = a[3] + b;
!ec
and if the two first iterations are  executed at the same by the SIMD instruction, the value of say $a[1]$ could be used by the second iteration before it has been calculated by the first iteration, leading thereby to wrong results.

!split
=====  Automatic vectorization and vectorization inhibitors, more data dependencies =====

On the other hand,  a so-called 
write-after-read statement can be vectorized. The following code
!bc cppcod
  double b = 15.;
  for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
      a[i-1] = a[i] + b;
  }
!ec
is an example of flow dependency that can be vectorized since no iteration with a higher value of $i$
can complete before an iteration with a lower value of $i$. However, such code leads to problems with parallelization.


!split
=====  Automatic vectorization and vectorization inhibitors, memory stride =====


For C++ programmers  it is also worth keeping in mind that an array notation is preferred to the more compact use of pointers to access array elements. The compiler can often not tell if it is safe to vectorize the code. 

When dealing with arrays, you should also avoid memory stride, since this slows down considerably vectorization. When you access array element, write for example the inner loop to vectorize using unit stride, that is, access successively the next array element in memory, as shown here
!bc cppcod
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
           a[i][j] += b[i][j];
      }  
  }
!ec

!split 
===== Compiling with and without vectorization =====
We can compile and link without vectorization using the clang c++ compiler
!bc cppcod
clang -o novec.x vecexample.cpp
!ec
and with vectorization (and additional optimizations)
!bc cppcod
clang++ -O3 -Rpass=loop-vectorize -o  vec.x vecexample.cpp 
!ec
The speedup depends on the size of the vectors. In the example here we have run with $10^7$ elements.
The example here was run on an IMac17.1 with OSX El Capitan (10.11.4) as operating system and an Intel i5 3.3 GHz CPU.  
!bc cppcod 
Compphys:~ hjensen$ ./vec.x 10000000
Time used  for norm computation=0.04720500000
Compphys:~ hjensen$ ./novec.x 10000000
Time used  for norm computation=0.03311700000
!ec
This particular C++ compiler speeds up the above loop operations with a factor of 1.5 
Performing the same operations for $10^9$ elements results in a smaller speedup since reading from main memory is required. The non-vectorized code is seemingly faster. 
!bc cppcod 
Compphys:~ hjensen$ ./vec.x 1000000000
Time used  for norm computation=58.41391100
Compphys:~ hjensen$ ./novec.x 1000000000
Time used  for norm computation=46.51295300
!ec
We will discuss these issues further in the next slides.  


!split 
===== Compiling with and without vectorization using clang =====
We can compile and link without vectorization with clang compiler
!bc cppcod
clang++ -o -fno-vectorize novec.x vecexample.cpp
!ec
and with vectorization
!bc cppcod
clang++ -O3 -Rpass=loop-vectorize -o  vec.x vecexample.cpp 
!ec
We can also add vectorization analysis, see for example
!bc cppcod
clang++ -O3 -Rpass-analysis=loop-vectorize -o  vec.x vecexample.cpp 
!ec
or figure out if vectorization was missed
!bc cppcod
clang++ -O3 -Rpass-missed=loop-vectorize -o  vec.x vecexample.cpp 
!ec




!split
=====  Memory management =====
The main memory contains the program data
* Cache memory contains a copy of the main memory data
* Cache is faster but consumes more space and power. It is normally assumed to be much faster than main memory
* Registers contain working data only
 * Modern CPUs perform most or all operations only on data in register
* Multiple Cache memories contain a copy of the main memory data
 * Cache items accessed by their address in main memory
 * L1 cache is the fastest but has the least capacity
 * L2, L3 provide intermediate performance/size tradeoffs
Loads and stores to memory can be as important as floating point operations when we measure performance.


!split
===== Memory and communication  =====


* Most communication in a computer is carried out in chunks, blocks of bytes of data that move together
* In the memory hierarchy, data moves between memory and cache, and between different levels of cache, in groups called lines
 * Lines are typically 64-128 bytes, or 8-16 double precision words
 * Even if you do not use the data, it is moved and occupies space in the cache
* This performance feature is not captured in most programming languages


!split
=====  Measuring performance =====

How do we measure erformance? What is wrong with this code to time a loop?
!bc
  clock_t start, finish;
  start = clock();
  for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
    a[j] = b[j]+b[j]*c[j];
  }
  finish = clock();
  double timeused = (double) (finish - start)/(CLOCKS_PER_SEC );
!ec

!split
=====  Problems with measuring time =====
o Timers are not infinitely accurate
o All clocks have a granularity, the minimum time that they can measure
o The error in a time measurement, even if everything is perfect, may be the size of this granularity (sometimes called a clock tick)
o Always know what your clock granularity is
o Ensure that your measurement is for a long enough duration (say 100 times the _tick_)


!split
=====  Problems with cold start =====

What happens when the code is executed? The assumption is that the code is ready to
execute. But
o Code may still be on disk, and not even read into memory.
o Data may be in slow memory rather than fast (which may be wrong or right for what you are measuring)
o Multiple tests often necessary to ensure that cold start effects are not present
o Special effort often required to ensure data in the intended part of the memory hierarchy.

!split
=====  Problems with smart compilers =====

o If the result of the computation is not used, the compiler may eliminate the code
o Performance will look impossibly fantastic
o Even worse, eliminate some of the code so the performance looks plausible
o Ensure that the results are (or may be) used.

!split
=====  Problems with interference =====
o Other activities are sharing your processor
  * Operating system, system demons, other users
  *  Some parts of the hardware do not always perform with exactly the same performance
o Make multiple tests and report
o Easy choices include
 *  Average tests represent what users might observe over time


!split
=====  Problems with measuring performance  =====
o Accurate, reproducible performance measurement is hard
o Think carefully about your experiment:
o What is it, precisely, that you want to measure
o How representative is your test to the situation that you are trying to measure?

===== Thomas algorithm for tridiagonal linear algebra equations =====

!bt
\[

        b_0 & c_0 &        &         &         \\

===== Thomas algorithm, forward substitution =====
!bblock
The first step is to multiply the first row by $a_0/b_0$ and subtract it from the second row.  This is known as the forward substitution step. We obtain then
!bt
\[
	a_i = 0,
\]
!et

!bt
\[                                 
	b_i = b_i - \frac{a_{i-1}}{b_{i-1}}c_{i-1},
\]
!et
and
!bt
\[
	f_i = f_i - \frac{a_{i-1}}{b_{i-1}}f_{i-1}.
\]
!et
At this point the simplified equation, with only an upper triangular matrix takes the form
!bt
\[
\left( \begin{array}{ccccc}
    b_0 & c_0 &        &         &         \\
       & b_1 &  c_1    &         &         \\
          &    & \ddots &         &         \\
	     &     &        & b_{m-2} & c_{m-2} \\
	        &    &        &         & b_{m-1}
   \end{array} \right)\left( \begin{array}{c}
       x_0     \\
       x_1     \\
       \vdots  \\
       x_{m-2} \\
       x_{m-1}
   \end{array} \right)=\left( \begin{array}{c}
       f_0     \\
       f_1     \\
       \vdots  \\
       f_{m-2} \\
       f_{m-1} \\
   \end{array} \right)
\]
!et
!eblock

!split
===== Thomas algorithm, backward substitution =====
!bblock
The next step is  the backward substitution step.  The last row is multiplied by $c_{N-3}/b_{N-2}$ and subtracted from the second to last row, thus eliminating $c_{N-3}$ from the last row.  The general backward substitution procedure is 
!bt
\[
	c_i = 0, 
\]
!et
and 
!bt
\[
	f_{i-1} = f_{i-1} - \frac{c_{i-1}}{b_i}f_i
\]
!et
All that remains to be computed is the solution, which is the very straight forward process of
!bt
\[
x_i = \frac{f_i}{b_i}
\]
!et

=====  How do we define speedup? Simplest form =====
!bblock
* Speedup(code,sys,p) = $T_b/T_p$
* Speedup measures the ratio of performance between two objects
* Versions of same code, with different number of processors
* Serial and vector versions
* Try different programing languages, c++ and Fortran
* Two algorithms computing the _same_ result 
!eblock

!split
=====  How do we define speedup? Correct baseline =====
!bblock
The key is choosing the correct baseline for comparison
* For our serial vs. vectorization examples, using compiler-provided vectorization, the baseline is simple; the same code, with vectorization turned off
*  For parallel applications, this is much harder:
  * Choice of algorithm, decomposition, performance of baseline case etc.
!eblock


!split
=====  Parallel  speedup =====
!bblock
For parallel applications, speedup  is typically defined as
* Speedup(code,sys,p) = $T_1/T_p$

Here  $T_1$ is the time on one processor and $T_p$ is the time using $p$ processors.
*  Can Speedup(code,sys,p) become larger than  $p$?
That means using $p$ processors is more than $p$ times faster than using one processor.
!eblock


!split
=====  Speedup and memory  =====
!bblock
The speedup on $p$ processors can
be greater than $p$ if memory usage is optimal!
Consider the case of a memorybound computation with $M$ words of memory
*  If $M/p$ fits into cache while $M$ does not, the time to access memory will be different in the two cases:
 * $T_1$ uses the main memory bandwidth
 * $T_p$ uses the appropriate cache bandwidth 

!eblock


!split
=====  Upper bounds on speedup =====
!bblock
Assume that almost all parts of a code are perfectly
parallelizable (fraction $f$). The remainder,
fraction $(1-f)$ cannot be parallelized at all.

That is, there is work that takes time $W$ on one process; a fraction $f$ of that work will take
time $Wf/p$ on $p$ processors. 
* What is the maximum possible speedup as a function of $f$? 
!eblock


!split
=====  Amdahl's law =====
!bblock
On one processor we have 
!bt
\[
T_1 = (1-f)W + fW = W
\]
!et
On $p$ processors we have
!bt
\[
T_p = (1-f)W + \frac{fW}{p},
\]
!et
resulting in a speedup of 
!bt
\[
\frac{T_1}{T_p} = \frac{W}{(1-f)W+fW/p}
\]
!et

As p goes to infinity, $fW/p$ goes to zero, and the maximum speedup is
!bt
\[
\frac{1}{1-f},
\]
!et 
meaning that if 
if $f = 0.99$ (all but $1\%$ parallelizable), the maximum speedup
is $1/(1-.99)=100$! 
!eblock


!split
=====  How much is parallelizable =====
!bblock
If any non-parallel code slips into the
application, the parallel
performance is limited. 

In many simulations, however, the fraction of non-parallelizable work
is $10^{-6}$ or less due to large arrays or objects that are perfectly parallelizable.

!split
=====    Today's situation of parallel computing  =====
!bblock

* Distributed memory is the dominant hardware configuration. There is a large diversity in these machines, from  MPP (massively parallel processing) systems to clusters of off-the-shelf PCs, which are very cost-effective.
* Message-passing is a mature programming paradigm and widely accepted. It often provides an efficient match to the hardware. It is primarily used for the distributed memory systems, but can also be used on shared memory systems.

* Modern nodes have nowadays several cores, which makes it interesting to use both shared memory (the given node) and distributed memory (several nodes with communication). This leads often to codes which use both MPI and OpenMP.

Our lectures will focus on both MPI and OpenMP.

!eblock

!split
=====  Overhead present in parallel computing =====
!bblock

* _Uneven load balance_:  not all the processors can perform useful work at all time.
* _Overhead of synchronization_
* _Overhead of communication_
* _Extra computation due to parallelization_

Due to the above overhead and that certain parts of a sequential
algorithm cannot be parallelized we may not achieve an optimal parallelization.
!eblock


!split
=====    Parallelizing a sequential algorithm  =====
!bblock

* Identify the part(s) of a sequential algorithm that can be  executed in parallel. This is the difficult part,
* Distribute the global work and data among $P$ processors.

!eblock




!split
===== Strategies =====
!bblock
* Develop codes locally, run with some few processes and test your codes.  Do benchmarking, timing and so forth on local nodes, for example your laptop or PC. 
* When you are convinced that your codes run correctly, you can start your production runs on available supercomputers.

!eblock

!split
===== How do I run MPI on a PC/Laptop? MPI  =====
!bblock
To install MPI is rather easy on hardware running unix/linux as operating systems, follow simply the instructions from the "OpenMPI website":"https://www.open-mpi.org/". See also subsequent slides.
When you have made sure you have installed MPI on your PC/laptop, 
* Compile with mpicxx/mpic++ or mpif90
!bc cppcod
  # Compile and link
  mpic++ -O3 -o nameofprog.x nameofprog.cpp
  #  run code with for example 8 processes using mpirun/mpiexec
  mpiexec -n 8 ./nameofprog.x
!ec
!eblock

!split
===== Can I do it on my own PC/laptop? OpenMP installation =====
!bblock
If you wish to install MPI and OpenMP 
on your laptop/PC, we recommend the following:
* For OpenMP, the compile option _-fopenmp_ is included automatically in recent versions of the C++ compiler and Fortran compilers. For users of different Linux distributions, siply use the available C++ or Fortran compilers and add the above compiler instructions, see also code examples below. 
* For OS X users however, use for example 
!bc cppcod
  brew install clang-omp
!ec
!eblock



!split
===== Installing MPI =====
!bblock
For linux/ubuntu users, you need to install two packages (alternatively use the synaptic package manager)
!bc cppcod
  sudo apt-get install libopenmpi-dev
  sudo apt-get install openmpi-bin
!ec
For OS X users, install brew (after having installed xcode and gcc, needed for the 
gfortran compiler of openmpi) and then install with brew
!bc cppcod
   brew install openmpi
!ec
When running an executable (code.x), run as
!bc cppcod
  mpirun -n 10 ./code.x
!ec
where we indicate that we want  the number of processes to be 10.

===== Installing MPI and using Qt =====
!bblock
With openmpi installed, when using Qt, add to your .pro file the instructions "here":"http://dragly.org/2012/03/14/developing-mpi-applications-in-qt-creator/"

You may need to tell Qt where openmpi is stored.

For the machines at the computer lab, openmpi is located  at 
!bc cppcod
 /usr/lib64/openmpi/bin
!ec
Add to your *.bashrc* file the following
!bc cppcod
  export PATH=/usr/lib64/openmpi/bin:$PATH

===== Using "Smaug":"http://comp-phys.net/cluster-info/using-smaug/", the CompPhys computing cluster =====
!bblock
For running on SMAUG, go to URL:"http://comp-phys.net/" and click on the link internals and click on
computing cluster.
To get access to Smaug, you will need to send us an e-mail with your name, UiO username, phone number, room number and affiliation to the research group. In return, you will receive a password you may use to access the cluster.

Here follows a simple recipe
!bc cppcod
   log in as ssh -username tid.uio.no
   ssh username@fyslab-compphys
!ec
In the folder 
!bc cppcod
    shared/guides/starting_jobs 
!ec
you will find a simple example on how to set up a job and compile and run.
This files are write protected. Copy them to your own folder and compile and run there.

=====    What is OpenMP =====
!bblock
* OpenMP provides high-level thread programming
* Multiple cooperating threads are allowed to run simultaneously
* Threads are created and destroyed dynamically in a fork-join pattern
  *  An OpenMP program consists of a number of parallel regions
  *  Between two parallel regions there is only one master thread
  *  In the beginning of a parallel region, a team of new threads is spawned
  * The newly spawned threads work simultaneously with the master thread
  * At the end of a parallel region, the new threads are destroyed

Many good tutorials online and excellent textbook
o  "Using OpenMP, by B. Chapman, G. Jost, and A. van der Pas":"http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/using-openmp"
o  Many tutorials online like "OpenMP official site":"http://www.openmp.org"

=====    Getting started, things to remember =====
!bblock
*  Remember the header file 
!bc cppcod
#include <omp.h>
!ec
*  Insert compiler directives in C++ syntax as 
!bc cppcod
#pragma omp...
!ec
* Compile with for example *c++ -fopenmp code.cpp*
* Execute
  * Remember to assign the environment variable _OMP NUM THREADS_
  * It specifies the total number of threads inside a parallel region, if not otherwise overwritten

!eblock

!split
===== OpenMP syntax =====
* Mostly directives
!bc cppcod
#pragma omp construct [ clause ...]
!ec
*  Some functions and types 
!bc cppcod
#include <omp.h>
!ec
*  Most apply to a block of code
 * Specifically, a _structured block_
 * Enter at top, exit at bottom only, exit(), abort() permitted


!split
===== Different OpenMP styles of parallelism =====
OpenMP supports several different ways to specify thread parallelism

* General parallel regions: All threads execute the code, roughly as if you made a routine of that region and created a thread to run that code
* Parallel loops: Special case for loops, simplifies data parallel code
* Task parallelism, new in OpenMP 3
* Several ways to manage thread coordination, including Master regions and Locks
* Memory model for shared data


!split
=====    General code structure  =====
!bblock
!bc cppcod
#include <omp.h>
main ()
{
int var1, var2, var3;
/* serial code */
/* ... */
/* start of a parallel region */
#pragma omp parallel private(var1, var2) shared(var3)
{
/* ... */
}
/* more serial code */
/* ... */
/* another parallel region */
#pragma omp parallel
{
/* ... */
}
}
!ec
!eblock

!split
=====    Parallel region =====
!bblock
* A parallel region is a block of code that is executed by a team of threads
* The following compiler directive creates a parallel region
!bc cppcod
#pragma omp parallel { ... }
!ec
* Clauses can be added at the end of the directive
* Most often used clauses:
 * _default(shared)_ or _default(none)_
 * _public(list of variables)_
 * _private(list of variables)_


!eblock

!split
=====    Hello world, not again, please! =====
!bblock

#include <cstdio>
int main (int argc, char *argv[])
{
int th_id, nthreads;
#pragma omp parallel private(th_id) shared(nthreads)
{
th_id = omp_get_thread_num();
printf("Hello World from thread %d\n", th_id);
#pragma omp barrier
if ( th_id == 0 ) {
nthreads = omp_get_num_threads();
printf("There are %d threads\n",nthreads);
}
}
return 0;

#pragma omp parallel
 {
   int id = omp_get_thread_num();
   int nproc = omp_get_num_threads(); 
   cout << "Hello world with id number and processes " <<  id <<  nproc << endl;
 } 
return 0;
}
!ec
Variables declared outside of the parallel region are shared by all threads
If a variable like _id_ is  declared outside of the 
!bc cppcod
#pragma omp parallel, 
!ec
it would have been shared by various the threads, possibly causing erroneous output
*  Why? What would go wrong? Why do we add  possibly?
!eblock

!split
=====    Important OpenMP library routines =====
!bblock

* _int omp get num threads ()_, returns the number of threads inside a parallel region
* _int omp get thread num ()_,  returns the  a thread for each thread inside a parallel region
* _void omp set num threads (int)_, sets the number of threads to be used
* _void omp set nested (int)_,  turns nested parallelism on/off

!eblock

!split
===== Private variables =====
!bblock
Private clause can be used to make thread- private versions of such variables: 
!bc cppcod
#pragma omp parallel private(id)
{
 int id = omp_get_thread_num();
 cout << "My thread num" << id << endl; 
}
!ec
* What is their value on entry? Exit?
* OpenMP provides ways to control that
* Can use default(none) to require the sharing of each variable to be described

!eblock

!split
===== Master region =====
!bblock
It is often useful to have only one thread execute some of the code in a parallel region. I/O statements are a common example
!bc cppcod
#pragma omp parallel 
{
  #pragma omp master
   {
      int id = omp_get_thread_num();
      cout << "My thread num" << id << endl; 
   } 
}
!ec


!eblock

!split
=====    Parallel for loop =====
!bblock
*  Inside a parallel region, the following compiler directive can be used to parallelize a for-loop:
!bc cppcod
#pragma omp for
!ec
* Clauses can be added, such as
 *  _schedule(static, chunk size)_
 *  _schedule(dynamic, chunk size)_ 
 *  _schedule(guided, chunk size)_ (non-deterministic allocation)
 *  _schedule(runtime)_
 *  _private(list of variables)_
 *  _reduction(operator:variable)_
 *  _nowait_

!eblock


!split
===== Parallel computations and loops =====

!bblock
OpenMP provides an easy way to parallelize a loop
!bc cppcod
#pragma omp parallel for
  for (i=0; i<n; i++) c[i] = a[i];
!ec
OpenMP handles index variable (no need to declare in for loop or make private)

Which thread does which values?  Several options. 
!eblock

!split
===== Scheduling of  loop computations =====

!bblock
We can let  the OpenMP runtime decide. The decision is about how the loop iterates are scheduled
and  OpenMP defines three choices of loop scheduling:
o Static: Predefined at compile time. Lowest overhead, predictable
o Dynamic: Selection made at runtime 
o Guided: Special case of dynamic; attempts to reduce overhead
!eblock

!split
===== Example code for loop scheduling =====

!bc cppcod
#include <omp.h>
#define CHUNKSIZE 100
#define N 1000
int main (int argc, char *argv[])
{
int i, chunk;
float a[N], b[N], c[N];
for (i=0; i < N; i++) a[i] = b[i] = i * 1.0;
chunk = CHUNKSIZE;
#pragma omp parallel shared(a,b,c,chunk) private(i)
{
#pragma omp for schedule(dynamic,chunk)
for (i=0; i < N; i++) c[i] = a[i] + b[i];
} /* end of parallel region */
}

=====    More on Parallel for loop =====
!bblock
* The number of loop iterations cannot be non-deterministic; break, return, exit, goto not allowed inside the for-loop
* The loop index is private to each thread
* A reduction variable is special
  * During the for-loop there is a local private copy in each thread
  * At the end of the for-loop, all the local copies are combined together by the reduction operation
* Unless the nowait clause is used, an implicit barrier synchronization will be added at the end by the compiler
!bc cppcod

===== What can happen with this loop? =====

!bblock
What happens with code like this 
!bc cppcod
#pragma omp parallel for
for (i=0; i<n; i++) sum += a[i]*a[i];
!ec  
All threads can access the _sum_ variable, but the addition is not atomic! It is important to avoid race between threads. So-called reductions in OpenMP are thus important for performance and for obtaining correct results.  OpenMP lets us indicate that a variable is used for a reduction with a particular operator. The above code becomes
!bc cppcod
sum = 0.0;
#pragma omp parallel for reduction(+:sum)
for (i=0; i<n; i++) sum += a[i]*a[i];
!ec

!ec
is another form of synchronization (in sequential order).
The form
!bc cppcod
#pragma omp critical { a block of codes }

=====    Some remarks  =====
!bblock

* When entering a parallel region, the _private_ clause ensures each thread having its own new variable instances. The new variables are assumed to be uninitialized.
* A shared variable exists in only one memory location and all threads can read and write to that address. It is the programmer's responsibility to ensure that multiple threads properly access a shared variable.
* The _firstprivate_ clause combines the behavior of the private clause with automatic initialization.
* The _lastprivate_ clause combines the behavior of the private clause with a copy back (from the last loop iteration or section) to the original variable outside the parallel region.

===== Not all computations are simple, competing threads =====

All threads are potentially accessing and changing the same values, _maxloc_ and _maxval_.
o OpenMP provides several ways to coordinate access to shared values

o Only one thread at a time can execute the following statement (not block). We can use the critical option

===== What can slow down OpenMP performance?   =====
!bblock
Performance poor because we insisted on keeping track of the maxval and location during the execution of the loop.
*  We do not care about the value during the execution of the loop, just the value at the end.

This is a common source of performance issues, namely the description of the method used to compute a value imposes additional, unnecessary requirements or properties

===== What is Message Passing Interface (MPI)?  =====
!bblock

_MPI_ is a library, not a language. It specifies the names, calling sequences and results of functions
or subroutines to be called from C/C++ or Fortran programs, and the classes and methods that make up the MPI C++
library. The programs that users write in Fortran, C or C++ are compiled with ordinary compilers and linked
with the MPI library.

MPI programs should be able to run
on all possible machines and run all MPI implementetations without change.

An MPI computation is a collection of processes communicating with messages.

* Here we have used the $MPI\_Barrier$ function to ensure that that every process has completed  its set of instructions in  a particular order.
* A barrier is a special collective operation that does not allow the processes to continue until all processes in the communicator (here $MPI\_COMM\_WORLD$) have called $MPI\_Barrier$. 
* The barriers make sure that all processes have reached the same point in the code. Many of the collective operations like $MPI\_ALLREDUCE$ to be discussed later, have the same property; that is, no process can exit the operation until all processes have started. 

However, this is slightly more time-consuming since the processes synchronize between themselves as many times as there
are processes.  In the next Hello world example we use the send and receive functions in order to a have a synchronized
action.

=====    Note 3  =====
!bblock


The basic sending of messages is given by the function $MPI\_SEND$, which in C/C++
is defined as 
!bc cppcod
int MPI_Send(void *buf, int count, 
             MPI_Datatype datatype, 
             int dest, int tag, MPI_Comm comm)}
!ec
This single command allows the passing of any kind of variable, even a large array, to any group of tasks. 
The variable _buf_ is the variable we wish to send while _count_
is the  number of variables we are passing. If we are passing only a single value, this should be 1. 

If we transfer an array, it is  the overall size of the array. 
For example, if we want to send a 10 by 10 array, count would be $10\times 10=100$ 
since we are  actually passing 100 values.  


!eblock


!split
=====    Note 4  =====
!bblock

Once you have  sent a message, you must receive it on another task. The function $MPI\_RECV$
is similar to the send call.
!bc cppcod
int MPI_Recv( void *buf, int count, MPI_Datatype datatype, 
            int source, 
            int tag, MPI_Comm comm, MPI_Status *status )
!ec

The arguments that are different from those in MPI\_SEND are
_buf_ which  is the name of the variable where you will  be storing the received data, 
_source_ which  replaces the destination in the send command. This is the return ID of the sender.

Finally,  we have used  $MPI\_Status\_status$,  
where one can check if the receive was completed.

The output of this code is the same as the previous example, but now
process 0 sends a message to process 1, which forwards it further
to process 2, and so forth.

===== How do I use $MPI\_reduce$? =====
!bblock

Here we have used
!bc cppcod
MPI_reduce( void *senddata, void* resultdata, int count, 
     MPI_Datatype datatype, MPI_Op, int root, MPI_Comm comm)
!ec

The two variables $senddata$ and $resultdata$ are obvious, besides the fact that one sends the address
of the variable or the first element of an array.  If they are arrays they need to have the same size. 
The variable $count$ represents the total dimensionality, 1 in case of just one variable, 
while $MPI\_Datatype$ 
defines the type of variable which is sent and received.  

The new feature is $MPI\_Op$. It defines the type
of operation we want to do. 
!eblock

!split
===== More on $MPI\_Reduce$ =====
!bblock
In our case, since we are summing
the rectangle  contributions from every process we define  $MPI\_Op = MPI\_SUM$.
If we have an array or matrix we can search for the largest og smallest element by sending either $MPI\_MAX$ or 
$MPI\_MIN$.  If we want the location as well (which array element) we simply transfer 
$MPI\_MAXLOC$ or $MPI\_MINOC$. If we want the product we write $MPI\_PROD$. 

$MPI\_Allreduce$ is defined as
!bc cppcod     
MPI_Allreduce( void *senddata, void* resultdata, int count, 
          MPI_Datatype datatype, MPI_Op, MPI_Comm comm)
