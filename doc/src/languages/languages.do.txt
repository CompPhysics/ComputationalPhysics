===== Extremely useful tools, strongly recommended =====

!bblock and discussed at the lab sessions the first two weeks
  * GIT for version control, discussed at the lab this week (and next week as well)
  * ipython notebook, mentioned this week 
  * QTcreator for editing and mastering computational projects
  * Armadillo as a useful numerical library for C++, highly recommended
  * Unit tests

===== A structured programming approach =====
!bblock

  * Before writing a single line, have the algorithm clarified and understood. It is crucial to have a logical structure of e.g., the flow and organization of data before one starts writing.
  * Always try to choose the simplest algorithm. Computational speed can be improved upon later.
  * Try to write a as clear program as possible. Such programs are easier to debug, and although it may take more time, in the long run it may save you time. If you collaborate with other people, it reduces spending time on debuging and trying to understand what the codes do. A clear program will also allow you to remember better what the program really does!

!split
===== A structured programming approach =====
!bblock

  * The planning of the program should be from top down to bottom, trying to keep the flow as linear as possible. Avoid jumping back and forth in the program. First you need to arrange the major tasks to be achieved. Then try to break the major tasks into subtasks. These can be represented by functions or subprograms. They should accomplish limited tasks and as far as possible be independent of each other. That will allow you to use them in other programs as well.
  * Try always to find some cases where an analytical solution exists or where simple test cases can be applied. If possible, devise different algorithms for solving the same problem. If you get the same answers, you may have coded things correctly or made the same error twice or more.

===== Getting Started =====

!bblock Compiling and linking, without QTcreator
In order to obtain an executable file for a C++ program, the following
instructions under Linux/Unix can be used

!bc sys
c++ -c -Wall myprogram.cpp
c++ -o myprogram myprogram.o
!ec
where the compiler is called through the command c++/g++. The compiler
option -Wall means that a warning is issued in case of non-standard
language. The executable file is in this case `myprogram`. The option
`-c` is for compilation only, where the program is translated into machine code,
while the `-o` option links the produced object file `myprogram.o`
and produces the executable `myprogram` .

For Fortran2008 we use the Intel compiler, replace `c++` with `ifort`.
Also, to speed up the code use compile options like

!bc sys
c++ -O3 -c -Wall myprogram.cpp
!ec
!eblock

!split
===== Makefiles and simple scripts =====

Under Linux/Unix it is often convenient to create a
so-called makefile, which is a script which includes possible
compiling commands.

!bc cppcod
# Comment lines
# General makefile for c - choose PROG =   name of given program
# Here we define compiler option, libraries and the  target
CC= g++ -Wall
PROG= myprogram
# this is the math library in C, not necessary for C++
LIB = -lm
# Here we make the executable file
${PROG} :          ${PROG}.o
                   ${CC} ${PROG}.o ${LIB} -o ${PROG}
# whereas here we create the object file
${PROG}.o :       ${PROG}.c
                  ${CC} -c ${PROG}.c
!ec
If you name your file for `makefile`, simply type the command
`make` and Linux/Unix executes all of the statements in the above
makefile. Note that C++ files have the extension `.cpp`.

!bblock The C encounter
Here we present first the C version. 

!bc cppcod
/* comments in C begin like this and end with */
#include <stdlib.h> /* atof function */
#include <math.h>   /* sine function */
#include <stdio.h>  /* printf function */
int main (int argc, char* argv[])
{
  double r, s;        /* declare variables */
  r = atof(argv[1]);  /* convert the text argv[1] to double */
  s = sin(r);
  printf("Hello, World! sin(%g)=%g\n", r, s);
  return 0;           /* success execution of the program */

!ec
!eblock

!split
===== Hello World, dissecting the code =====

!bblock Dissection I
The compiler must see a declaration of a function before you can
call it (the compiler checks the argument and return types).
The declaration of library functions appears
in so-called ``header files'' that must be included in the program, e.g.,

!bc cppcod
   #include <stdlib.h> /* atof function */
!ec
We call three functions (atof, sin, printf)
and these are declared in three different header files.
The main program is a function called main
with a return value set to an integer, int (0 if success).
The operating system stores the return value,
and other programs/utilities can check whether
the execution was successful or not.
The command-line arguments are transferred to the main function through

!bc cppcod
   int main (int argc, char* argv[])
!ec
!eblock

!split
===== Hello World, more dissection =====

!bblock Dissection II
The command-line arguments are transferred to the main function through

!bc cppcod
   int main (int argc, char* argv[])
!ec
The integer `argc` is the no of command-line arguments, set to
one in our case, while
`argv` is a vector of strings containing the command-line arguments
with `argv[0]` containing  the name of the program
and `argv[1]`, `argv[2]`, ... are the command-line args, i.e., the number of
lines of input to the program.
Here we define floating points, see also below,
through the keywords `float` for single precision real numbers and
`double` for double precision. The function
`atof` transforms a text (`argv[1]`) to a float.
The sine function is declared in math.h, a library which
is not automatically included and needs to be linked when computing
an executable file.

With the command `printf` we obtain a formatted printout.
The `printf` syntax is used for formatting output
in many C-inspired languages (Perl, Python, Awk, partly C++).

===== "Hello World with namespace":"https://github.com/CompPhysics/ComputationalPhysicsMSU/blob/master/doc/Programs/LecturePrograms/programs/IntroProgramming/cpp/hellow.cpp" =====

!bblock Now in C++
Here we present the C++ version using namespace.
!bc cpppro
// A comment line begins like this in C++ programs
// Standard ANSI-C++ include files
#include <iostream>   // input and output
#include <cmath>      // math functions
using namespace std;
int main (int argc, char* argv[])
{
  // convert the text argv[1] to double using atof:
  double r = atof(argv[1]);  // convert the text argv[1] to double
  double s = sin(r);
  cout << "Hello, World! sin(" << r << ") =" << s << endl;
  return 0;           // success execution of the program 
}
!ec
!eblock


!split
===== "Hello World without namespace":"https://github.com/CompPhysics/ComputationalPhysicsMSU/blob/master/doc/Programs/LecturePrograms/programs/IntroProgramming/cpp/hellownonamespace.cpp" =====

!bblock Without namespace
Namespaces provide a method for preventing name conflicts in large projects.
Symbols declared inside a namespace block are placed in a named scope that prevents them from being mistaken for identically-named symbols in other scopes.
Multiple namespace blocks with the same name are allowed. All declarations within those blocks are declared in the named scope.


Here we present the C++ version without using namespace.
!bc cpppro
// A comment line begins like this in C++ programs
// Standard ANSI-C++ include files
#include <iostream>   // input and output
#include <cmath>      // math functions
using namespace std;
int main (int argc, char* argv[])
{
  // convert the text argv[1] to double using atof:
  double r = atof(argv[1]);  // convert the text argv[1] to double
  double s = sin(r);
  // Note std::cout and std::endl
  std::cout << "Hello, World! sin(" << r << ") =" << s << std::endl;
  return 0;           // success execution of the program 
}
!ec
!eblock




!split
===== C++ Hello World =====

!bblock Dissection I
We have replaced the call to `printf` with the standard C++ function
`cout`. The header file `<iostream.h>` is then needed.
In addition, we don't need to
declare variables like `r` and `s`  at the beginning of the program.
I personally prefer
however to declare all variables at the beginning of a function, as this
gives *me* a feeling of greater readability.

===== Brief summary =====

!bblock C/C++ program
  * A C/C++ program begins with include statements of header files (libraries,intrinsic functions etc)
  * Functions which are used are normally defined at top (details next week)
  * The main program is set up as an integer, it returns 0 (everything correct) or 1 (something went wrong)
  * Standard `if`, `while` and `for` statements as in Java, Fortran, Python...
  * Integers have a very limited range.
!eblock

!split
===== Brief summary =====

!bblock Arrays
  * A C/C++ array begins by indexing at 0!
  * Array allocations are done by size, not by the final index value.If you allocate an array with 10 elements, you should index them from $0,1,\dots, 9$.
  * Initialize always an array before a computation.

===== Loss of Precision =====

!bblock Machine Numbers
In the decimal system we would write a number like $9.90625$
in what is called the normalized scientific notation.

!bt
\[
  9.90625=0.990625\times 10^{1},
\]
!et
and a real non-zero number could be generalized as

!bt
\begin{equation}
    x=\pm r\times 10^{{\mbox{n}}},
\end{equation}
!et
with $r$ a number in the range $1/10 \le r < 1$.
In a similar way we can use represent a binary number in
scientific notation as

!bt
\begin{equation}
    x=\pm q\times 2^{{\mbox{m}}},
\end{equation}
!et
with $q$ a number in the range $1/2 \le q < 1$.
This means that the mantissa of a binary number would be represented by
the general formula
!bt
\begin{equation}
(0.a_{-1}a_{-2}\dots a_{-n})_2=a_{-1}\times 2^{-1}
+a_{-2}\times 2^{-2}+\dots+a_{-n}\times 2^{-n}.
\end{equation}
!et
!eblock

!split
===== Loss of Precision =====

!bblock Machine Numbers
In a typical computer, floating-point numbers are represented
in the way described above, but with certain restrictions
on $q$ and $m$ imposed by the available word length.
In the machine, our
number $x$ is represented as

!bt
\begin{equation}
    x=(-1)^s\times {\mbox{mantissa}}\times 2^{{\mbox{exponent}}},
\end{equation}
!et

where $s$ is the sign bit, and the exponent gives the available range.
With a single-precision word, 32 bits, 8 bits would typically be reserved
for the exponent,  1 bit for the sign and 23 for the mantissa.
!eblock

!split
===== Loss of Precision =====

!bblock Machine Numbers
A modification of the scientific notation for binary numbers is to
require that the leading binary digit 1 appears to the left of the binary point.
In this case the representation of the mantissa $q$ would be
$(1.f)_2$ and $ 1 \le q < 2$. This form is rather useful when storing
binary numbers in a computer word, since we can always assume that the leading
bit 1 is there. One bit of space can then be saved meaning that a 23 bits
mantissa has actually 24 bits. This means explicitely that a binary number with 23 bits
for the mantissa reads

!bt
\begin{equation}
(1.a_{-1}a_{-2}\dots a_{-23})_2=1\times 2^0+a_{-1}\times 2^{-1}+
+a_{-2}\times 2^{-2}+\dots+a_{-23}\times 2^{-23}.
\end{equation}
!et
!eblock

!split
===== Loss of Precision, example =====
As an example, consider the 32 bits binary number
!bblock
!bt
\[
(10111110111101000000000000000000)_2,
\]
!et
where the first bit is reserved for the sign, 1 in this case yielding a
negative sign. The exponent $m$ is given by the next 8 binary numbers
$01111101$ resulting in 125 in the decimal system.
!eblock

!split
===== Loss of Precision =====

!bblock Machine Numbers
However, since the
exponent has eight bits, this means it has  $2^8-1=255$ possible numbers in the interval
$-128 \le m \le 127$, our final
exponent is $125-127=-2$ resulting in $2^{-2}$.
Inserting the sign and the mantissa yields the final number in the decimal representation as

!bt
\[
 -2^{-2}\left(1\times 2^0+1\times 2^{-1}+
1\times 2^{-2}+1\times 2^{-3}+0\times 2^{-4}+1\times 2^{-5}\right)=\]
!et

!bt
\[
(-0.4765625)_{10}.
\]
!et
In this case we have an exact machine representation with 32 bits (actually, we need less than
23 bits for the mantissa).
!eblock

!split
===== Loss of Precision, consequences =====
!bblock
If our number $x$ can be exactly represented in the machine, we call
$x$ a machine number. Unfortunately, most numbers cannot  and are thereby
only approximated in the machine. When such a number occurs as the result
of reading some input data or of a computation, an inevitable error
will arise in representing it as accurately as possible by
a machine number.
!eblock

!split
===== Loss of Precision =====

!bblock Machine Numbers
A floating number x, labelled $fl(x)$ will therefore always be represented as

!bt
\begin{equation}
  fl(x) = x(1\pm \epsilon_x),
\end{equation}
!et
with $x$ the exact number and the error $|\epsilon_x| \le |\epsilon_M|$, where
$\epsilon_M$ is the precision assigned. A number like $1/10$ has no exact binary representation
with single or double precision. Since the mantissa

!bt
\[
\left(1.a_{-1}a_{-2}\dots a_{-n}\right)_2
\]
!et
is always truncated at some stage $n$ due to its limited number of bits, there is only a
limited number of real binary numbers. The spacing between every real binary number is given by the
chosen machine precision.
For a 32 bit words this number is approximately
$ \epsilon_M \sim 10^{-7}$ and for double precision (64 bits) we have
$ \epsilon_M \sim 10^{-16}$, or in terms of a binary base
as $2^{-23}$ and $2^{-52}$ for single and double precision, respectively.
!eblock

!split
===== Loss of Precision =====

!bblock Machine Numbers
In the machine a number is represented as

!bt
\begin{equation}
  fl(x)= x(1+\epsilon)
\end{equation}
!et

where $|\epsilon| \leq \epsilon_M$ and $\epsilon$ is given by the
specified precision, $10^{-7}$ for single and $10^{-16}$ for double
precision, respectively.
$\epsilon_M$ is the given precision.
In case of a subtraction $a=b-c$, we have

!bt
\begin{equation}
   fl(a)=fl(b)-fl(c) = a(1+\epsilon_a),
\end{equation}
!et
or
!bt
\begin{equation}
   fl(a)=b(1+\epsilon_b)-c(1+\epsilon_c),
\end{equation}
!et
!eblock
!split
===== Loss of Precision =====
!bblock
The above means that
!bt
\begin{equation}
   fl(a)/a=1+\epsilon_b\frac{b}{a}- \epsilon_c\frac{c}{a},
\end{equation}
!et

and if $b\approx c$ we see that there is a potential for an increased
error in $fl(a)$.
!eblock

!split
===== Loss of Precision =====

!bblock Machine Numbers
Define
the absolute error as
!bt
\begin{equation}
   |fl(a)-a|,
\end{equation}
!et
whereas the relative error is
!bt
\begin{equation}
   \frac{ |fl(a)-a|}{a} \le \epsilon_a.
\end{equation}
!et
!eblock
!split
===== Loss of Precision =====
!bblock
The above subraction is thus

!bt
\begin{equation}
   \frac{ |fl(a)-a|}{a}=\frac{ |fl(b)-fl(c)-(b-c)|}{a},
\end{equation}
!et
yielding

!bt
\begin{equation}
   \frac{ |fl(a)-a|}{a}=\frac{ |b\epsilon_b- c\epsilon_c|}{a}.
\end{equation}
!et
The relative error
is the quantity of interest in scientific work. Information about the
absolute error is normally of little use in the absence of the magnitude
of the quantity being measured.
!eblock

!split
===== Loss of numerical precision =====

Suppose we wish to evaluate the function

!bt
\[
   f(x)=\frac{1-\cos(x)}{\sin(x)},
\]
!et
for small values of $x$. Five leading digits. If we multiply the denominator and numerator
with $1+\cos(x)$ we obtain the equivalent expression

!bt
\[
   f(x)=\frac{\sin(x)}{1+\cos(x)}.
\]
!et

If we now choose $x=0.007$ (in radians) our choice of precision results in

!bt
\[
   \sin(0.007)\approx 0.69999\times 10^{-2},
\]
!et
and

!bt
\[
   \cos(0.007)\approx 0.99998.
\]
!et

!split
===== Loss of numerical precision =====

The first expression for $f(x)$ results in

!bt
\[
   f(x)=\frac{1-0.99998}{0.69999\times 10^{-2}}=\frac{0.2\times 10^{-4}}{0.69999\times 10^{-2}}=0.28572\times 10^{-2},
\]
!et
while the second expression results in

!bt
\[
   f(x)=\frac{0.69999\times 10^{-2}}{1+0.99998}=
\frac{0.69999\times 10^{-2}}{1.99998}=0.35000\times 10^{-2},
\]
!et
which is also the exact result. In the first expression, due to our
choice of precision, we have
only one relevant digit in the numerator, after the
subtraction. This leads to a loss of precision and a wrong result due to
a cancellation of two nearly equal numbers.
If we had chosen a precision of six leading digits, both expressions
yield the same answer.

!split
===== Loss of numerical precision =====

If we were to evaluate $x\sim \pi$, then the second expression for $f(x)$
can lead to potential losses of precision due to cancellations of nearly
equal numbers.

This simple example demonstrates  the loss of numerical precision due
to roundoff errors, where the number of leading digits is lost
in a subtraction of two near equal numbers.
The lesson to be drawn is that we cannot blindly compute a function.
We will always need to carefully analyze our algorithm in the search for
potential pitfalls. There is no magic recipe however, the only guideline
is an understanding of the fact that a machine cannot represent
correctly *all* numbers.

!split
===== Loss of precision can cause serious problems =====

!bblock Real Numbers

  * _Overflow_: When the positive exponent exceeds the max value, e.g., 308 for `DOUBLE PRECISION` (64 bits). Under such circumstances the program will terminate and some compilers may give you the warning `OVERFLOW`.
  * _Underflow_: When the negative exponent becomes smaller than the min value, e.g., -308 for `DOUBLE PRECISION`. Normally, the variable is then set to zero and the program continues. Other compilers (or compiler options) may warn you with the `UNDERFLOW` message and the program terminates.

may be stored in the following way. The exponent is  small
and is stored in full precision. However,
the mantissa is not stored fully. In double precision (64 bits), digits
beyond the
15th are lost since the mantissa is normally stored in two words,
one which is the most significant one representing
123456 and the least significant one containing 789111213. The digits
beyond 3 are lost. Clearly, if we are summing alternating series
with large numbers, subtractions between two large numbers may lead
to roundoff errors, since not all relevant digits are kept.
This leads eventually to the next problem, namely

===== More on loss of precision =====

!bblock Real Numbers

  * _Loss of precision_: When one has to e.g., multiply two large numbers where one suspects that the outcome may be beyond the bonds imposed by the variable declaration, one could represent the numbers by logarithms, or rewrite the equations to be solved in terms of dimensionless variables. When dealing with problems in e.g., particle physics or nuclear physics where distance is measured in fm ($10^{-15}$ m), it can be quite convenient to redefine the variables for distance in terms of a dimensionless variable of the order of unity. To give an example, suppose you work with single precision and wish to perform the addition $1+10^{-8}$. In this case, the information containing in $10^{-8}$ is simply lost in the addition. Typically, when performing the addition, the computer equates first the exponents of the two numbers to be added. For $10^{-8}$ this has however catastrophic consequences since in order to obtain an exponent equal to $10^0$, bits in the mantissa are shifted to the right. At the end, all bits in the mantissa are zeros.

  \epsilon_{\mbox{approx}}\approx \frac{f_0^{(4)}}{12}h^{2}.

===== Error Analysis =====

!bblock
If we were not to worry about loss of precision, we could in principle
make $h$ as small as possible.
However, due to the computed expression in the above program example

!bt
\[
 f_0''=\frac{ f_h -2f_0 +f_{-h}}{h^2}=\frac{ (f_h -f_0) +(f_{-h}-f_0)}{h^2},
\]
!et
we reach fairly quickly a limit for where loss of precision due to the subtraction
of two nearly equal numbers becomes crucial.

If $(f_{\pm h} -f_0)$ are very close, we have
$(f_{\pm h} -f_0)\approx \epsilon_M$, where $|\epsilon_M|\le 10^{-7}$ for single and
$|\epsilon_M|\le 10^{-15}$ for double precision, respectively.

We have then

!bt
\[
 \left|f_0''\right|=
 \left|\frac{ (f_h -f_0) +(f_{-h}-f_0)}{h^2}\right|\le \frac{ 2 \epsilon_M}{h^2}.
\]
!et
!eblock

!split
===== Error Analysis =====

!bblock
Our total error becomes

!bt
\[
   \left|\epsilon_{\mbox{tot}}\right|\le  \frac{2 \epsilon_M}{h^2} +
                          \frac{f_0^{(4)}}{12}h^{2}.
    label{eq:experror}
\]
!et
It is then natural to ask which value of $h$ yields the smallest
total error. Taking the derivative of $\left|\epsilon_{\mbox{tot}}\right|$
with respect to $h$ results in

!bt
\[
   h= \left(\frac{ 24\epsilon_M}{f_0^{(4)}}\right)^{1/4}.
\]
!et
With double precision and $x=10$ we obtain

!bt
\[
   h\approx 10^{-4}.
\]
!et
Beyond this value, it is essentially the loss of numerical precision
which takes over.
!eblock

!split
===== Error Analysis =====

!bblock
Due to the subtractive cancellation in the expression
for $f''$ there is a pronounced detoriation in accuracy as $h$ is made smaller
and smaller.

It is instructive in this analysis to rewrite the numerator of
the computed derivative as

!bt
\[
   (f_h -f_0) +(f_{-h}-f_0)=(e^{x+h}-e^{x}) + (e^{x-h}-e^{x}),
\]
!et
as

!bt
\[
   (f_h -f_0) +(f_{-h}-f_0)=e^x(e^{h}+e^{-h}-2),
\]
!et
since it is the difference $(e^{h}+e^{-h}-2)$ which causes
the loss of precision.

===== Call by value or reference =====
C++ allows the programmer to use solely call by reference (note that call by reference is implemented as pointers). To see the difference between C and C++, consider the following simple examples.
In C we would write

!bc cppcod
   int n; n =8;
   func(&n); /* &n is a pointer to n */
   ....
   void func(int *i)
   {
     *i = 10; /* n is changed to 10 */
     ....
   }
!ec
whereas in C++ we would write
!bc cppcod
   int n; n =8;
   func(n); // just transfer n itself
   ....
   void func(int& i)
   {
     i = 10; // n is changed to 10
     ....
   }
!ec

===== Call by value or reference =====
The reason why we emphasize the difference between call by value and call
by reference is that it allows the programmer to avoid pitfalls
like unwanted changes of variables. However, many people feel that this
reduces the readability of the code.

===== Call by value and reference, F90/95 =====

In Fortran we can use `INTENT(IN)`, `INTENT(OUT)`, `INTENT(INOUT)` to let the
program know which values should or should not be changed.

!bc fcod
SUBROUTINE coulomb_integral(np,lp,n,l,coulomb)
  USE effective_interaction_declar
  USE energy_variables
  USE wave_functions
  IMPLICIT NONE
  INTEGER, INTENT(IN)  :: n, l, np, lp
  INTEGER :: i
  REAL(KIND=8), INTENT(INOUT) :: coulomb
  REAL(KIND=8) :: z_rel, oscl_r, sum_coulomb
  ...
!ec
This hinders unwanted changes and increases readability.
