    "\n",
    "Why object orientation?\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Three main topics: objects, class hierarchies and polymorphism\n",
    "\n",
    "  * The aim here is to be to be able to write a more general code which can easily be tailored to new situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Polymorphism** is a term used in software development to describe a variety of techniques employed by programmers to create flexible and reusable software components. The term is Greek and it loosely translates to \"many forms\". Strategy: try to single out the variables needed to describe a given system and those needed to describe a given solver. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Object orientation\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming languages, a polymorphic object is an entity, such as a variable or a procedure, that can hold or operate on values of differing types during the program's execution. Because a polymorphic object can operate on a variety of values and types, it can also be used in a variety of programs, sometimes with little or no change by the programmer. The idea of write once, run many, also known as code reusability, is an important characteristic to the programming paradigm known as Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).\n",
    "\n",
    "OOP describes an approach to programming where a program is viewed as a collection of interacting, but mostly independent software components. These software components are known as objects in OOP and they are typically implemented in a programming language as an entity that encapsulates both data and procedures.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Programming classes\n",
    "\n",
    "In Fortran a vector or matrix start with $1$, but it is easy\n",
    "to change a vector so that it starts with zero or even a negative number.\n",
    "If we have a double precision Fortran vector  which starts at $-10$ and ends at $10$, we could declare it as\n",
    "`REAL(KIND=8) ::  vector(-10:10)`. Similarly, if we want to start at zero and end at 10 we could write\n",
    "`REAL(KIND=8) ::  vector(0:10)`.\n",
    "We have also seen that Fortran  allows us to write a matrix addition $\\mathbf{A} = \\mathbf{B}+\\mathbf{C}$ as\n",
    "`A = B + C`.  This means that we have overloaded the addition operator so that it translates this operation into\n",
    "two loops and an addition of two matrix elements $a_{ij} = b_{ij}+c_{ij}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Programming classes\n",
    "\n",
    "The way the matrix addition is written is very close to the way we express this relation mathematically. The benefit for the\n",
    "programmer is that our code is easier to read. Furthermore, such a way of coding makes it  more likely  to spot eventual\n",
    "errors as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Ansi C and C++ arrays start by default from $i=0$.  Moreover, if we  wish to add two matrices we need to explicitely write out\n",

    "However,\n",
    "the strength of C++ is the possibility\n",
    "to define new data types, tailored to some particular problem.\n",
    "Via new data types and overloading of operations such as addition and subtraction, we can easily define\n",
    "sets of operations and data types which allow us to write a matrix addition in exactly the same\n",
    "way as we would do in Fortran.  We could also change the way we declare a C++ matrix elements $a_{ij}$, from  $a[i][j]$\n",
    "to say $a(i,j)$, as we would do in Fortran. Similarly, we could also change the default range from $0:n-1$ to $1:n$.\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The function and class declarations are fundamental concepts within C++.  Functions are abstractions\n",
    "which encapsulate an algorithm or parts of it and perform specific tasks in a program.\n",
    "We have already met several examples on how to use  functions.\n",
    "Classes can be defined as abstractions which encapsulate\n",
    "data and operations on these data.\n",
    "The data can be very complex data structures  and the class can contain particular functions\n",
    "which operate on these data. Classes allow therefore for a higher level of abstraction in computing.\n",
    "The elements (or components) of the data\n",
    "type are the class data members, and the procedures are the class\n",
    "member functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Programming classes\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes are user-defined tools used to create multi-purpose software which can be reused by other classes or functions.\n",
    "These user-defined data types contain data (variables) and\n",
    "functions operating on the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple example is that of a point in two dimensions.\n",
    "The data could be the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of a given  point. The functions\n",
    "we define could be simple read and write functions or the possibility to compute the distance between two points.\n",
    "\n",

    "   * Different parts of a project can be tested without the need to wait for the other parts to be available.\n",
