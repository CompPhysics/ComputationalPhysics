    "1. [The Patriot Missile failure](http://www-users.math.umn.edu/~arnold/disasters/patriot.html), in Dharan, Saudi Arabia, on February 25, 1991 which resulted in 28 deaths, is ultimately attributable to poor handling of rounding errors.\n",

    "3. [The sinking of the Sleipner A](http://www-users.math.umn.edu/~arnold/disasters/sleipner.html) offshore platform in Gandsfjorden near Stavanger, Norway, on August 23, 1991, resulted in a loss of nearly one billion dollars.
