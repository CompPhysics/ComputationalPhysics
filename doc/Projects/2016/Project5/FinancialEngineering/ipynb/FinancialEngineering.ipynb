    "  * Describe the algorithm you have used and/or developed. Here you may find it convenient to use pseudocoding. In many cases you can describe the algorithm in the program itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Include the source code of your program. Comment your program properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * If possible, try to find analytic solutions, or known limits in order to test your program when developing the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Include your results either in figure form or in a table. Remember to        label your results. All tables and figures should have relevant captions        and labels on the axes.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Try to evaluate the reliabilty and numerical stability/precision of your results. If possible, include a qualitative and/or quantitative discussion of the numerical stability, eventual loss of precision etc.\n",

    "  * Try to give an interpretation of you results in your answers to  the problems.\n",

We wish to keep this course at the interactive level and your comments can help us improve it.\n",

You may find such a logbook very handy at later stages in your work, especially when you don't properly remember  what a previous test version  of your program did.

Do not include library files which are available at the course homepage, unless you have made specific changes to them.\n",
